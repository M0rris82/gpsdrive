In Progress:
------------

====================================================================

Joerg:
------
Staighten the naming of variables and functions
   -first step done, but stil a long way to go
	still open:
		longi --> lon
		xy_draw --> draw_xy
		cb_t_xy		for Callback Timer xy 
		cb_c_xy		for Callback of Checkbox xy 
		bt_xy		for Button xy 
		load_xy		for loading Data for xy
		save_xy		for saving Data for xy

Database (SQL):
make gpsdrive read directly from mysql without first writing a file.
   -first step done

Vertor map Data:
	Add code for showing Vectormap Data. 
	Decide about internal representation and structure vektor map data.

new POI(Point Of Interest) Database support:
	- started. 
		- It already shows points in database (lat/lon/name/Icon)
		- Import of 2.500.000 Points seems to work


in das einstellungsmen√º verlagern:
	Speichere Spur 
ins pulldown diverse verlegen:
	Starte gpsd 
	Karte herunterladen

====================================================================

ChrisJastram:
-------------

Map rotation, ego-centric style (we are always pointing up)

====================================================================

Fritz:
------

Start Doxygen Documentation

change config File handling








####################################################################

Unassigned:
-----------

Modularising:
	Put every drawing layer into a seperate module.

	moving configuration Data into a structure

	moving actual settings into another structure
	
	move more stuff from gpsdrive.c into standalone Files
		examples:
		- waypoint.{c,h}
		- gps_handling.{c.h}
		- icons.{c.h}

Documentation:
	Write comments to all the existing code
	Write man Pages
	Translate man Pages
	Translate in Programm Text

Icons:
	Draw Icons for different Waypoint Types
	think about waypoint type names

Makefiles:
	include generation of icon Directory while installing gpsdrive
	
Vektor Map Sources:
	Find new Sources for Maps with Free Licence
	Write conversion routines/scripts for these different map Sources 
	to import them into the local mySQL Database 
	
Distribution:
	update the distribution dependant Files (debian, suse, ...)

Central POI Server:
	We want to set up an central POI(Point of interrest) Server. 
	Idea is: to populate this Server from all the point of interrests
		 you have. 
		Then give the Server a Web-interface(first step) to download alle 
		these POIs and import them into your local DB.
		Further steps will be to write sync-routines to
		sync this local Data with the central Server.

====================================================================

Unassigned User Requests:
-------------------------

	- Autosave Tracks periodically
		- started: savetrack was seperated and got 
 			   option to save only aktuall Track an not track_ALL.sav

====================================================================

DONE:
-----
- draw grid: Add text to draw-grid to see which lat/lon this gridline belongs to.

- Add Waypoint with one Keypress


====================================================================

Old (has to be checked):
------------------------

Command line switch to set gpsd hostname and port for remote control.

Add additional server: expedia.com

Add  load of trackings (i.e. stored in the GPS and
converted with a nice perl script anyone will write).

Servermode to display different positions provided over Internet
server.


resizing of window
centering of map to selected points

render maps in greyscale

create ~/.gpsdrive directory and files if missing.
