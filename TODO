Modularising:
Put every drawing layer into a seperate module.

Database (SQL):
make gpsdrive read directly from mysql without first writing a file.

Vertor map Data:
Add code for showing Vectormap Data. Decide about internal representation
and structure vektor map data.

Waypoints:
Decide about the structure of waypoints


draw grid:
Add text to draw-grid to see which lat/lon this gridline belongs to.
Find a more inteligent algorithm to determine which gridlines are to be displayed.

Command line switch to set gpsd hostname and port for remote control.

Add additional server: expedia.com

Add  load of trackings (i.e. stored in the GPS and
converted with a nice perl script anyone will write).

Servermode to display different positions provided over Internet
server.
