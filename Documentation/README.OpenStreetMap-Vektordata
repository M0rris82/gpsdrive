Download and import Vektormaps from OSM:
----------------------------------------
The Vectormaps have to be downloaded from OpenStreetMap (planet.openstreetmap.org). 
Normally you would do this by starting:

 geoinfo.pl --db-user=root --db-password=<mysql-root-pwd> --create-db    --fill-defaults

 geoinfo.pl --db-user=root --db-password=<mysql-root-pwd> --osm   

The second would download the monthly snapshot 
    Currently planet-2006-07.osm.bz2
unpack it and import it to the mysql Database. 

After installing the monthly snapshot you can use the point
of interests from openstreetmap to search for a location.
The Street Data is no longer imported this way. To see the 
Street Data from OpenStreetMap in GpsDrive you'll have to 
use the Mapnik Plugin
