Download and import Vektormaps from OSM:
----------------------------------------
The Vectormaps have to be downloaded from osm (www.openstreetmap.org) or 
better one of the mirrors. 
Normally you would do this by starting:

 geoinfo.pl --db-user=root --db-password=<mysql-root-pwd> --create-db    --fill-defaults

 geoinfo.pl --db-user=root --db-password=<mysql-root-pwd> --osm   

The second would download the monthly snapshot 
    Currently planet-2006-07-a.osm.bz2
from my mirror http://www.ostertag.name/osm/index.html
unpack it and import it to the mysql Database. 

After installing the monthly snapshot you can just switch off all 
other mapsources in the GUI. Then switch on Streets and POI.
If there is Data available for your Area you should see the 
Streets in the normal map Area.

This should normally work for any region in the world, BUT ...

Lets start with the OSM Servers:
--------------------------------
The OSM Servers have limited resources, so please DON'T USE the following 
method for larger areas. 

Planet.osm problem:
-------------------
Currently the extracting script has problems in parts of the US, so they 
currently only include the western Hemisphere into the monthly planet.osm
snapshots. 

OSM Account:
------------
For all of the following methods you need an direct account to the 
openstreetmap.org (osm) Servers. (It's easy to get; Only a valid e-mail 
address is needed). After this you can normally download and edit the 
Vectordata of your area. 

Working with JOSM:
------------------
For editing and downloading Data from/to osm I normally use josm. 
It's a java Program for editing the Vectordata on osm. josm also allows 
to save the downloaded/edited area into a file. If you now save the 
Vektordata to a local File (mypath/myplace.osm for example); you can 
add this Data to the mysql database 
with the following command:
  geoinfo.pl -db-user=root --db-password=<mysql-root-pwd> --osm=mypath/myplace.osm  --no-delete


Automatic Download (please use with care and small Areas):
----------------------------------------------------------
And then you can use another Method to add more details to your Area.
The following command would do this:
  geoinfo.pl -db-user=root --db-password=<mysql-root-pwd> --osm=download:myplace --no-delete
If you don't want to download munich, you'd have to add a corresponding 
myplace to the list of valid places in scripts/Geo/Gpsdrive/OSM.pm:
	my $download_area = {
	    #             lat1,lon1  lat2,lon2
	    muenchen  => [ 10,  44,  14,48],
	};

--------------------------------------------

> Also I'd love to use the vector maps for Canada and US as mentioned on
> the list.  What directories are required for these?

As already mentioned above the planet.osm don't include the US-Tiger data. So the 
only possibility would be to either use a direct download of your area and then import it 
with 
  geoinfo.pl -db-user=root --db-password=<mysql-root-pwd> --osm=mypath/myplace.osm  --no-delete
or use 
  geoinfo.pl -db-user=root --db-password=<mysql-root-pwd> --osm=download:myplace --no-delete
