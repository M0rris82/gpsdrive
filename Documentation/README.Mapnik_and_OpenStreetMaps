About

GpsDrive now supports OpenStreetMap Maps with the help of the
Mapnik renderer. To activate this mode you have to build GpsDrive
with the Mapnik option enabled. Once enabled you will have to
download a .osm "planet file" for your country and move it into
a PostGIS (PostgreSQL + spatial extension) database. You will
also need to install the world boundary ShapeFiles, available
from the GpsDrive website's package repository (300mb).

Once this is all in place you can switch on the "Mapnik Mode"
check box in the Map Control GUI, and you should start to see
custom generated map tiles appear wherever you roam, with no
need to be connected to the internet to get new tiles. Already-
generated tiles are cached.

== Setup PostgreSQL ==

Create Database

You need to be authenticated as the PostgreSQL super user in order
to execute many of the commands below. You can not login as this user.
Instead as root enter:

$> su
#> su - postgres

As the postgres user run the following to create the database:

NOTE: Replace username with the user that will be using mapnik.

$> createuser username
 Shall the new role be a super user(y/n) y
$> createdb -E UTF8 -O username gis
$> createlang plpgsql gis

The new database will be called "gis".

Setup PostGIS

As the postgresql super user:

NOTE: Replace username with the user that will be using Mapnik.

$> psql -d gis -f /usr/share/postgresql-8.3-postgis/lwpostgis.sql
$> echo "ALTER TABLE geometry_columns OWNER TO username; \
         ALTER TABLE spatial_ref_sys OWNER TO username;" | \
	 psql -d gis
$> exit
#> exit


Install the OSM data

Download OSM data

NOTE Before downloading the whole of the world data (>3GB) consider
how much of this you really need. I downloaded only the data for my 
country as at this time I have no need for other places.

$> cd /usr/local/src/gpsdrive

For the whole world

$> wget http://planet.openstreetmap.org/planet-latest.osm.bz2

For local extracts see:

    * http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Planet.osm#Extracts 


Put the osm data into the database

$> cd /usr/local/src/gpsdrive
$> osm2pgsql -m -d gis planet-latest.osm.bz2

or

$> osm2pgsql -m -d gis your_downloaded_data_file.osm

or you can limit the data by using a bounding box

$> osm2pgsql --bbox minlon,minlat,maxlon,maxlat -m \
      -d gis your_down_loaded_data_file.osm

    * minlat = minimum latitude
    * minlon = minimum longitude
    * maxlat = maximum latitude
    * maxlon = maximum longitude
    * Negative for latitude south and longitude west. 

This took about 3 minutes for my country and I understand that
for the world it takes several days.


See
    * http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Mapnik#Tuning_the_database 
and
    * http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Mapnik#Loading_data 

if you intend loading the whole world and/or encounter problems
with loading the data.

This is done at this stage rather than using the script
("mapnik-osm-updater.sh") provided by gpsdrive as it gives you a 
chance to correct any possible errors early in the stage.

Setuping up Mapnik

If you installed using the .deb packages these steps should, for
the most part, be unneeded.

Move world boundaries/coastlines to Mapnik directory

$> su
#> cd /usr/local/src/gpsdrive
#> mv world_boundaries /usr/lib/mapnik


Create a link to the ttf-dejavu fonts

#> ln -s /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/ /usr/lib/mapnik/0.5/fonts


Create a link to the Mapnik icons

#> ln -s /usr/share/icons/openstreetmap/ /usr/local/share/icons/map-icons


Create a link to the Mapnik libraries

#> ln -s /usr/lib/mapnik /usr/local/share


Test gpsdrive

Run from a terminal to check infomation sent to standard output.

$> gpsdrive

Anything other then the following may indicate incorrect operation.


DB: Using waypoints from local user file.
DB: Using waypoints from OpenStreetMap database.
Read 576 POI-Types from geoinfo.db


You should be able to select Mapnik mode from the Map Control GUI.
Assuming you have added the OSM data then the map should be
dynamically generated.


 * That's it you should now have a working
   gpsdrive/mapnik/openstreetmap setup.
