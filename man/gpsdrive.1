.SH About this manual page

This manual page explains the basic functions of GpsDrive and some
additional info.

In GpsDrive you find tooltips for nearly all buttons, there is also a
HELP button for usage of the keys and mouse buttons.

For special purposes read the README files, i.e. README.kismet,
README.SQL ...

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B Gpsdrive 
is a car (bike, ship, plane) navigation system.  Displaying your
position on a map and a lot of other functions are implemented.

.B This manual page describes GpsDrive version 2.x

GpsDrive displays your position provided from your NMEA capable GPS
receiver on a zoomable map . The maps are autoselected depending on
your position. You can set the preferred scale, which the program tries to
get from available maps.

GpsDrive was tested with a GARMIN GPS III, a Crux II GPS PCMCIA
card and a Navilock USB receiver. All Garmin GPS reveivers with a serial output should be
usable. Other GPS receivers that sends NMEA protocol over the
serial output should also work with GpsDrive.

These GPS receivers are reported to work with gpsdrive:

.SH CONNECTING A GPS RECEIVER
First you have to choose if you want use the GARMIN or NMEA mode.

.B NMEA mode.
.br
This is the most used mode. This mode is provided by most GPS
receivers. 
.br
To use NMEA mode, you have to start the provided program
.B gpsd
first
.B Start GPSD
This program runs as daemon in background and provides a server,
which sends the GPS data on port number 2947. 
The settings /dev/gps and 4800 BPS are precompiled if you start
gpsd.

You can also change the gpsd settings i.e. to ttyS1 call it with:
.br
.B gpsd -p /dev/ttyS1

If you are using a GPS receiver with an USB connection, your port may
be
.B /dev/ttyUSB0
for the first device.

Be sure to select NMEA protocol and a baudrate of 4800 BPS in your
GPS receiver.

To see the output of you GPS do 
.B telnet localhost 2947
and after the connect hit the 
.B R
key to see the NMEA sentences.

.B NMEA sentences used
.br
Following NMEA sentences are used for specified informations:

.I GPRMC: 
Position, Speed, Heading 
.br
.I GPGSV: 
Satellite signal level display
.br
.I GPGGA: 
Altitude (not available on all receivers) and position if no GPRMC is
available. In this case, speed and heading are calculated by GpsDrive.
.br
.I PGRME: 
Display EPE (estimated position error), perhaps only available on
GARMIN receivers

At least you need GPRMC or GPGGA for using GpsDrive. If you can turn
on GPRMC, please do so.

.SH USAGE

Start GpsDrive as normal user with:
.B gpsdrive
from your shell, if you want another language see section 
.I LOCALISATION

On some distributions you may find a "GpsDrive" entry in your Gnome or
KDE menu.

It is important that you have installed GpsDrive as root, so it can
find the necessary files. 
.B Don't start GpsDrive as root!

You can use GpsDrive without a GPS device connected. If you do so,
GpsDrive will automatically start in
.B Simulator mode 
if no working GPS receiver is connected and no gpsd
is running. This mode is shown by a rotating globe.

In simulator mode the pointer can move on the map (if enabled in settings
menu). You can also stop gpsd if it is already running with the "Stop GPSD" Button.

If you have connected a GPS-Receiver, you see in the 
.I GPS Info
window how many satellites are in view. You can click on this image to switch to the 
.I Satellite position view.
.br
You must have at least 3 satellites in view. If you want to see your
altitude, you need at least 4 satellites.  The antenna of your GPS
receiver must have free sight to the sky, so you cannot use it
indoors. More satellites gives you a better accuracy.

If your receiver has not enough satellites with usable signal, the
GPS Info window is red. If your signal is ok and gives a valid
position, the GPS Info window is green.

There are 3 modes in which GpsDrive is operating:

.B Normal mode:

This mode is entered if you have a GPS receiver connected. The cursor is at the position your receiver sends.

Black and a red arrows show your position on the map. The 
.B black arrow
is pointing to your selected target, the 
.B red arrow
shows the direction in which you are moving.
.br
If you have no valid position the arrows are blinking.

.B Simulation

If GpsDrive finds no GPS-receiver at program start, it
shows the last position and the cursor will move to the targets you
set. You can set your target by right-mouse click on the map or by
selecting a waypoint from the FIND menu.

.B Position mode

This mode is activated by clicking on the "Pos. mode" button or if you
"Jump" to a target in the FIND menu.

In this mode, you can temporarily change the position for looking around and
jumping to other positions (i.e. for downloading maps). In this mode this
is 
.B not your real position
and is marked as an rectangle.

You can set the position by a simple left-mouse click on the map.

You can leave the position mode by by clicking on the "Pos. mode"
button or middle-mouse click or right-mouse click (which also sets
your target).


.SH OPENSTREETMAP MAPS
GpsDrive now supports OSM maps with the help of the renderer Mapnik.
To activate this mode you have to choose the mapnik option.


.SH MAP DOWNLOAD

You can easily download maps from the internet with the
.B Download
button. GpsDrive stores an index of your maps in the file
map_koord.txt in your  ~/.gpsdrive directory. You can also use any
directory for your maps, but you have to set this in the
settings menu.

.SH About maps

There is a file called "map_koord.txt" in your ~/.gpsdrive
directory. Here is a sample:

top_WORLD.jpg 0,00000 0,00000 88226037
.br
map_file0000.gif 53,60751 10,01145 3160000
.br
map_file0001.gif 43,08210 12,24552 3160000
.br
map_file0002.gif 49,81574 9,71454 7900000
.br
map_file0003.gif 47,72837 14,46487 592500
.br


The first row is the filename, then comes the latitude, the longitude
and the scale of the map. The scale of 10000000 is good for Europe,
and 100000 is for a town. To see detailed streets in a city, choose a
scale like 10000 or 5000.

GpsDrive selects the map with the best scale for your position. So get
a map i.e for Europe, Austria and Vienna if you want to drive in
Vienna.


There is also the program
.IR gpsfetchmap.pl
provided to download multiple maps for a bigger area.
.br
.B Please consider the copyright information at 
www.expedia.com if you want to use their maps!
.br
.B Don't misuse this service by downloading more maps as you need! 
You will risk being blocked by these servers, and possibly cause
trouble for the gpsdrive project.

File formats:

The decimal points in way.txt must always be a dot ('.'), in
map_koord.txt '.' or ',' are possible. If you download maps from
within the program, GpsDrive writes the map_koord.txt respecting your
LC_NUMERIC setting.


.SH Can I use other maps?

You can also use your own (self drawn, scanned...) maps. The maps must
be gif, jpeg, png or other common file formats (the format must be
recognized by the gdk-pixbuf library).  The lat/long coordinates you
write into the "map_koord.txt" file has to be the center of the map. The
map must have a size of 1280x1024 pixels! 

Important! The maps must be named "map_*" for UTM-like projections
(lat:lon = 1:cos(lat)) and "top_*" for lat/lon Plate carrée projection
(lat:lon = 1:1). The prefix is given so that gpsdrive knows how to
scale the maps correctly. Alternatively the maps can be stored without
prefix in subdirectories of $HOME/.gpsdrive/ which end in "_map" or
"_top".

There is an "import assistant" built in. Use it to import your maps.

.SH Importing waypoints:

The manual way:

You may create a file "way.txt" in your ~/.gpsdrive directory
which looks like:

DFN-Cert                53.577694    9.991263 FRITZ
.br
Finkenwerder            53.541765    9.842541 AIRPORT
.br
Fritz_Wohnung           53.582700    9.971390 FRITZ

The rows are: label latitude longitude waypoint-type. You may omit the
waypoint type.

There is no need to create the way.txt file yourself, you can add the
waypoints with GpsDrive using the "x" key. See help menu.



.SH Route planning
There is no route planning feature at the moment. Route planning would
need the use of commercial maps and a database license which costs
more than EUR 10.000. 

.SH PROXY SERVER
If you must access the internet via a proxy server, you have to set the
enviromental variable
.B HTTP_PROXY
or
.B http_proxy
to a value like
.I http://proxy.provider.com:3128
where 3128 in this example is the proxy port.

.SH MOUSE CONTROL
You can switch on the
.B Position mode
by selecting this option in the menu.

If you switched to "position mode" a rectangle is the
cursor and no position is shown. If you zoom or select another map
scale with the slider, this is done for the position of the
rectangle-cursor in the same manner as it would be your actual
position. If you click with the left button near the border, GpsDrive will
scroll the map or load the next map if you are on the margin of the map.

The middle mouse button or the "Pos. mode" menu entry switches back to
normal mode. The same happens if you select a target with the right
mouse button.  Shift-left-mouse-button and shift-right-mouse-button
or using the mouse wheel changes the map scale.

Please have also a look into the
.B Help
menu in GpsDrive to be informed about the actual mouse functions and key
shortcuts.

.SH Add new waypoints
You can simply add new waypoints in two ways:

o To add a waypoint at the
.B current (GPS) position, 
simply press CTRL and RIGHT-mouse-click. You can also press the
.B x
key.

o To add a waypoint at the
.B mouse position,
simply press CTRL and LEFT-mouse-click. You can also press the
.B y
key.

In the popup window add the waypoint name (spaces will be converted to
underscores) and choose a waypoint type (see below for predefined
waypoint types).
 
.SH Icons for waypoints
At the moment there a three different icon themes available, but not
everone has distinct icons for every type. Currently you can choose the
themes only by editing the entry "icon_theme" in the config file
"~/.gpsdrive/gpsdriverc". The possible themes are:
"square.big", "square.small" and "classic".

.SH SQL support

For managing a larger number of waypoints you should use SQL
support. This needs to install a SQL server on your machine. At the
moment, only MySQL is supported.

Don't be afraid, MySQL doesn't need much resources, is very fast, and makes the
management (including selection of waypoint types) of the waypoints
much easier. In SQL mode you can select the waypoints to display in the
.B setup
menu.

GpsDrive use MySQL automatically if it finds the shared library 
.I libmysqlclient.so.10 
and the MySQL Server is running and a connection to the database is possible. For first use you have to run 
.B geoinfo.pl --create-db --fill-defaults
once.

.B Please read README.SQL for information how to setup the SQL database.



.SH Routes
A route is a list of waypoints. GpsDrive guides you from one waypoint
to the next on the route. 
You can add waypoints to a route using
the waypoint (select target) window. You can also add comments to a
waypoint which will be spoken by the speech system and also be shown
in the map window as scrolling text.

.SH Comments for routes
To add comments create a file with the same name as the waypoint file,
but change the suffix to .dsc, i.e way-trip.txt and way-trip.dsc, then
enter the comments in the way*.dsc file in the kind of:

$waypointname
Text which is displayed and spoken

$nextwaypointname
another text

Example:

$Fritz_Wohnung
Hier wohnt Fritz, der Autor von diesem Programm. Er freut sich auf Besuch und eine Einladung zu einem saftigen Steak.
                                                                                
$Hubertus
Hier wohnt Hubertus, ein Freund von Fritz.

There is no limit of the length of the comment. Important is to start
the line with '$name' and the comment in the next lines.

.SH KISMET support
Gpsdrive supports
.IR kismet.
Kismet is a 802.11b wireless network (WLAN) sniffer. If you have
kismet running, gpsdrive will detect it and program starts and shows
new WLAN access points in real time on the map. SQL mode is necessary to
use Gpsdrive with Kismet. WLAN accesspoints which are already
stored in the SQL database from prior wardrivings are ignored. If you
have voice output in gpsdrive, you hear information about the newly
found accesspoint.

Please see also the file
.IR README.kismet

.SH LOCALISATION

If you have installed the program it will display messages in english,
german, french, italian, dutch, dansk, hungarian, slovak, swedish, turkish or
spanish if your language is set either with LANG or LANGUAGE. LANGUAGE
overrides all other settings. Call "locale" to see the settings and
call "set" if LANG or LANGUAGE is set. For german do:

.B export LANGUAGE=de

and then call gpsdrive in this shell.

You can also start it with the line 
.B LANGUAGE=de gpsdrive
without setting the language for the shell.

Sometimes you have to do use LANG instead of LANGUAGE.

If your own language isn't available, please contact me if you want to
make the translations.

.SH SPEECH OUTPUT

If you want speech output you have to install the festival speech output
system.
See 
.I http://fife.speech.cs.cmu.edu/festival
for information.

For german output you have to get the german festival from
.I www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/phonetik/synthesis/index.html

If you have a functional festival software call it as server with:

festival --server

When you start GpsDrive it will detect the server on port 1314 and
puts out some status information as speech. You also have an
additional button (Mute) to switch off sound output.

GpsDrive tries to select the correct language for your locale.
The -l option can force the languages for speech
output. At the moment english, spanish, and german are supported. GpsDrive
sets festival into the proper language. If the initialisation is not
correct, have a look into 
.I gpsdrive.c
and edit following defines do your needs:

#define FESTIVAL_ENGLISH_INIT "(voice_ked_diphone)"

#define FESTIVAL_GERMAN_INIT "(voice_german_de3_os)"

#define FESTIVAL_SPANISH_INIT "(voice_el_diphone)"

For this, you need the voices ked_diphone for english, german_de3_os
for german (this is a MBROLA voice) and el_diphone for spanish.

There is now an unsupported build of festival including english, german
and spanish support.
.B Download 
it from GpsDrive homepage 
.B mirrors
and extract
the tar file in the directory /usr/local as root:

.br 
cd /usr/local
.br
tar -xvzf festivalbuild.tar.gz

Start the server with
.B /usr/local/festival/bin/festival --server


.SH FRIENDSD server

There is a server program, called
.B friendsd
which acts as server for the position of your friends. If you enable
it in the settings menu, 
then you can see the position of all gpsdrive connected with this
server. 

You will see the position of your friends as a car symbol on the map,
including the name, time, day of week and the speed of his last connection.
The blue arrow shows the last reported direction of your friend.

The time is transmitted as UTC, but shown on the display as your local time, 
so it is also correct if your friend lives in another time zone.

The server uses port 50123 (UDP), so be sure that you open the port in
your firewall. The server needs no root privileges and should run as
normal user or a special user with no privileges. The server was NOT
tested for security.

There is a friends server running on friends.gpsdrive.de, you can try it
if you enable it in the settings menu.

You can also send messages to other mobile targets (Misc. Menu/Messages)


.SH MAILING LIST
The address for the mailing list is 
.B gpsdrive@warbase.selwerd.nl

Subscribing can be done by sending a mail containing 
.B subscribe gpsdrive 

to majordomo@warbase.selwerd.nl

.SH BUGS
Please send bug reports to the author. Report version (gpsdrive -v),
screen size and info how to reproduce the bug. It is also a big help
to run gpsdrive for a minute with the -d option and send me the output.

If gpsdrive crashes with a segfault, I need a backtrace of the program
in addition. To create a backtrace do following:

Extract the tar file, change to gpsdrive directory and do
.br
 ./configure \-\-with\-debug
.br
 make clean
.br
 make
.br
 cd src
.br
 gdb ./gpsdrive

Inside the debugger do:

run (if you use arguments write it after run)

When you get the segfault type in:

bt

and send me this output.
