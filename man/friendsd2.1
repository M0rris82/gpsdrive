.SH DESCRIPTION

.B Friendsd2
is a central daemon which takes UDP packets from gpsdrive clients and
stores them. Later he sends them back to all the connecte gpsd-client
so they can show all the Geo-Locations of all other users connected to
this friendsd. One central friendsd is running at friends.gpsdrive.de.
 
.SH BUGS

The current friendsd can only hold a limited number of users, since he
sends only one UDP packet to the client for response.
