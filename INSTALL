# How to build from source

## Requirements

### Common requirements

In order to build the gpsdrive, you need to install several components:

- A C++ compiler
- [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) >= 2.4.4.
- [GTK2](http://www.gnome.org/)
- [mapnik](http://www.mapnik.org/) >= 0.4

There are also some platform specific requirements listed below.

Note that these version numbers are version we know works correctly. If you
build and run the gpsdrive successfully with an older version, please let us
know.

### Optional requirements

- [gdal](http://www.gdal.org/)

### Specific requirements for GNU/Linux

The default compiler should be gcc 4.0 or newer.

Other components:

### Specific requirements for MacOS X

- [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) >= 0.9.8a
- [GNU TLS](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/) >= 1.2.9
- [GLib](http://www.gtk.org/) >= 2.10.3

GLib and GNU TLS can be installed using [Fink](http://www.finkproject.org) or
[MacPorts](http://www.macports.org).

### Specific requirements for Windows


## Building
First, you need to configure the compilation, using CMake. Go inside the
`build` dir.

Windows with Visual C++:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
    nmake

Windows with MinGW:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
    make

GNU/Linux and MacOS X:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
    make

### CMake standard options
Here is a list of the most interesting options provided out of the box by CMake.

- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: The type of build (can be Debug Release MinSizeRel RelWithDebInfo)
- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: The prefix to use when running make install (Default to
  /usr/local on GNU/Linux and MacOS X)
- CMAKE_C_COMPILER: The path to the C compiler
- CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER: The path to the C++ compiler

### CMake options defined for gpsdrive

Options are defined in the following files:

- DefineOptions.cmake

They can be changed with the -D option:

`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_GDAL=ON ..`

### Browsing/editing CMake options

In addition to passing options on the command line, you can browse and edit
CMake options using `cmakesetup` (Windows) or `ccmake` (GNU/Linux and MacOS X).

- Go to the build dir
- On Windows: run `cmakesetup`
- On GNU/Linux and MacOS X: run `ccmake ..`

## Running

The gpsdrive binary can be found in the `build` directory.
