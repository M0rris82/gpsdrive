Please read the gpsdrive man page. To do so, install the program and type 
  man gpsdrive

into a terminal window. With KDE Konqueror you can also see it with the URL:
  man:gpsdrive

Most usage information is now stored in the man page!

Also have a look at the old revision changelog at 
  http://www.gpsdrive.de/changes.shtml

and the various README.* files in the Documentation/ directory.

How to install the program:
----------------------

To compile gpsdrive you need quite a few development packages.
These requirements are detailed in the DEVPACKAGES text file. 

Most importantly you will need a C compiler (gcc >=3.x) and 'make'.


To compile from the tarball:

Extract it with "tar -xvzf gpsdrive*tar.gz"
  cd gpsdrive
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug
  make

If you don't need the support of Mapnik and dislike having GDAL ...
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug -DWITH_GDAL=OFF -DWITH_MAPNIK=OFF

See "cmake -L .." for more variables to treak.

To install the program, the gpsd daemon and the language files you should
(as root) do:
  make install


After compiling and installing* read the manpage of gpsdrive or start the
program if you are to lazy to read manuals. ;-) Or read it online.
[*] install is needed for localized versions of the man page.



Quick Guide to get started:
---------------------------

  # Compile and install
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug
  make
  make install
 
  # import Mapnik from German Planet File(as root):
  mapnik-osm-updater.sh --all-planet-geofabrik=europe/germany
  ... wait a little time ... wait a little longer ... 
 
  # make directory
  mkdir ~/.gpsdrive
 
  # fetch additional maps
  gpsfetchmap.pl -w gpsd -a 1
 
  # start gpsdrive
  gpsdrive

You can also download the RPM file and install it:
  rpm -Uvh gpsdrive*.rpm


On Debian Systems you can also download the .deb file and install it:
  dpkg --install gpsdrive*.deb
But don't forget to download and install the new icon Files
  dpkg --install openstreetmap-map-icons-classic_*.deb
  dpkg --install openstreetmap-map-icons_*.deb
And the OpenStreetmap Utilities for using Mapnik Maps ...
  dpkg --install openstreetmap-utils*.deb
    



Uninstall:
---------

If you installed using the source tarball:
  GpsDrive uses cmake to build, which has no uninstall target for some
  reasons. After running "make install" you should find a file
  "install_manifest.txt" inside your build directory, that holds a list
  of all the files installed.

If you used the RPM package:
  rpm -e gpsdrive

Debian:
  aptitude remove openstreetmap-utils gpsdrive openstreetmap-map-icons.*

You can find much more information in the manual page, read it with
"man gpsdrive" or online at http://www.gpsdrive.de/man-en.html



enjoy!
