How to install the program:
----------------------

To compile gpsdrive you need quite a few development packages.
These requirements are detailed in the DEVPACKAGES text file. 

Most importantly you will need a C compiler (gcc >=3.x) and 'make'.


To compile from the tarball:

Extract it with "tar -xvzf gpsdrive*tar.gz"
  cd gpsdrive
  ./configure 
  make

If you don't need the support of the GARMIN protocol (you are using
only NMEA protocol) you should configure GpsDrive with:
  ./configure --disable-garmin

You can also add --enable-auto-optimization for optimized compiler flags.
See "./configure --help" for all options.


To install the program, the gpsd daemon and the language files you should
(as root) do:
  make install


After compiling and installing* read the manpage of gpsdrive or start the
program if you are to lazy to read manuals. ;-) Or read it online.
[*] install is needed for localized versions of the man page.



Quick Guide to get started:
---------------------------

  # Compile and install
  ./configure
  make
  make install
 
  # create database
  geoinfo.pl  --create-db --fill-defaults --openstreetmap \
               --db-user=root --db-password=<our mysql root password>
 
  # make directory
  mkdir ~/.gpsdrive
 
  # fetch additional maps
  gpsfetchmap.pl -w gpsd -a 1
 
  # start gpsdrive
  gpsdrive


If errors occur in ./configure, try running ./autogen.sh first.

You can also download the RPM file and install it:
  rpm -Uvh gpsdrive*.rpm



Uninstall:
---------

If you installed using the tarball:

cd into the gpsdrive directory (not the src), then
  make uninstall

If you used the rpm package:
  rpm -e gpsdrive


You can find much more information in the manual page, read it with
"man gpsdrive" or online at http://www.gpsdrive.de/man-en.html



enjoy!
