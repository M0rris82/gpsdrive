How to install the program:
----------------------

To compile gpsdrive you need quite a few development packages.
These requirements are detailed in the DEVPACKAGES text file. 

Also 
compiler gcc >=3.x
and make


To compile from the tarball:

Extract it with "tar -xvzf gpsdrive*tar.gz"
cd gpsdrive
./configure 
make

If you don't need the support of the GARMIN protocol (you are using
only NMEA protocol) you should configure GpsDrive with:

./configure --disable-garmin

You can also add --enable-auto-optimization for optimized compiler flags.


As root you should do a 
make install

to install the program, the gpsd daemon and the language files.

After compiling and installing (install is needed for localisation)
read the manpage of gpsdrive or start the program if you are to lazy
to read manuals. ;-)

You can also download the RPM file and install it:

rpm -Uvh gpsdrive*.rpm

Uninstall:
---------

If you installed using the tarball:

cd into the gpsdrive directory (not the src), then

make uninstall

If you used the rpm package:

rpm -e gpsdrive



Much more information you find in the manual page, read it with "man
gpsdrive" or online at
