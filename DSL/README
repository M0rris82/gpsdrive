Introduction
------------
These instructions will help you to create a  package that can be installed on DSL.
It has been tested on Debian and gpsdrive appears to compile and be binary compatible
with DSL.  DSL grew out of Knoppix which grew out of Debian.

Compile
--------
Have a look through the DEVPACKAGES file and install ALL of the required packages.
Change to the DSL directory and run the build.sh file.  If this completes with a 
"success" message you should have a runable gpsdrive program that you can execute 
happily on debian.  It is installed to /opt/gpsdrive.

Package
--------
Next you need to turn gpsdrive into an installable package for DSL.
Create a folder named "package" two levels up from the DSL source folder.
cd to the DSL folder and run the package.sh script.  This will build 
all the required files in to an archive file named gpsdrive.tar.gz and 
stick it in a folder named ../../package/gpsdrive.  This is what the DSL
installer uses.  You don't need to unpack it manually

Install
-------
To install on DSL First download and install the package named gtk2-0705.dsl
using the mydsl package installer normally found on the desktop.  

Then install gpsdrive.tar.gz using the mydsl button in the Emelfm file manager.
Check out the DSL home page for all the different install options.

Note:
I have noticed that sometimes after installing Gpsdrive the desktop icon doesn't 
start the application.  Installing it again seems to solve the problem.
I have no idea why and the files don't appear any different.  It is something 
to do with the Desktop link file /home/dsl/.xtdesktop/Gpsdrive.lnk

All of the program files are installed into /opt/gpsdrive with the following
exceptions.  If these files already exist on your copy of DSL  you may have 
problems with other software already installed on your system. 
None of them exist in a default build of DSL.

/etc/gtk-2.0/gdk-pixbuf.loaders
/etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules
/etc/pango/pango.modules
/etc/pango/pangox.aliases

Use the desktop icon to start the program. 
(I know the icon is lame, feel free to build a better one)
If you prefer to use the command line then the following should work.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/gpsdrive/lib /opt/gpsdrive/bin/gpsdrive

I haven't done extensive testing but the program seems to be fully operational.
If you find problems please post details on the GPSDrive Mailing list.

GPSD
-----
As it appears that direct serial support is soon to be no longer supported in gpsdrive 
gpsd will be needed to make the connection to your gps.  I'm currently working on creating 
package scripts for gpsd.  They are working but arn't in the gpsdrive source tree yet.

MYSQL
-----
I'm also working on getting Mysql into DSL and it is looking like being bigger
than getting gpsdrive in there.  At the moment it is a work in progress.
i.e. Not working
