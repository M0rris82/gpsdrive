GPSDrive for DSL
========================

This package is intended to be installed on Damn Small Linux (DSL)
it was constructed from the CVS files downloaded from CVS and compiled
on Debian linux.

To install on DSL First download and install the package named gtk2-0705.dsl
using the mydsl package installer normally found on the desktop.  

Then install gpsdrive.tar.gz using the mydsl button in the Emelfm file manager.

Note:
I have noticed that sometimes after installing Gpsdrive the desktop icon doesn't 
start the application.  Installing it again seems to solve the problem.
I have no idea why and the files don't appear any different.  It is something 
to do with the Desktop link file /home/dsl/.xtdesktop/Gpsdrive.lnk

All of the program files are installed into /opt/gpsdrive with the following
exceptions.  If these files already exist on your copy of DSL  you may have 
problems with other software already installed on your system. 
None of them exist in a default build of DSL.

/etc/gtk-2.0/gdk-pixbuf.loaders
/etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules
/etc/pango/pango.modules
/etc/pango/pangox.aliases

Use the desktop icon to start the program. 
(I know the icon is lame, feel free to build a better one)
If you prefer to use the command line then the following should work.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/gpsdrive/lib /opt/gpsdrive/bin/gpsdrive

I haven't done extensive testing but the program seems to be fully operational.
If you find problems please post details on the GPSDrive Mailing list.
