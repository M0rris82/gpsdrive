Description: Car navigation system
 GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane) navigation system.
 GpsDrive displays your position provided from gpsd on a zoomable map, 
 the map file is autoselected depending of the position and preferred
 scale. Speech output is supported if the "espeak" software is 
 installed. All GPS receivers which supports NMEA protocol should
 be usable.
 For using Maps from OpenStreetMap you need to install the openstreetmap-* 
 packages.

 This Package is a small set of utils used to setup and operate GpsDrive.
 The Large Set for it would be openstreetmap-utils.
