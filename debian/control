Description: Car navigation system
 GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane) navigation system.
 GpsDrive displays your position provided from gpsd which gets it
 from your NMEA or Garmin capable GPS receiver on a zoomable map, 
 the map file is autoselected depending of the position and preferred
 scale. Speech output is supported if the
 "festival" software is running. The maps are autoselected for best
 resolution depending of your position. All Garmin GPS reveiver with a
 serial output should be usable, also other GPS receiver which supports
 NMEA protocol.
