Description: GPS navigation system
 GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane, foot) navigation system.
 GpsDrive displays your position provided from a GPS on a zoomable map,
 the map file is autoselected depending on your position and preferred
 map scale.  All GPS receivers which support the NMEA protocol should
 be usable, as well as many USB GPSs using a binary protocol.
 .
 You will most likely want to install the gpsd package so that you
 can talk to your GPS; without that GpsDrive is just a map viewer.
 Speech output is supported if the "espeak" software is installed.
 To use maps from the OpenStreetMap project you need to install the
 openstreetmap-* packages as well.

 This package contains a small set of helper scripts used to setup and
 enhance GpsDrive.
 The Large Set for it would be openstreetmap-utils.

Description: GpsDrive default continental overview mapset
 GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane, foot) navigation system.
 GpsDrive displays your position provided from a GPS on a zoomable map,
 the map file is autoselected depending on your position and preferred
 map scale.  All GPS receivers which support the NMEA protocol should
 be usable, as well as many USB GPSs using a binary protocol.
 .
 This Package contains the overview maps for GpsDrive.  These are
 derived from the NASA's Blue Marble satellite maps. These maps will
 get you started, but you will probably want to download or create
 some local maps of your own. It also includes ancillary files.

Description: Friendsd for GPS navigation system
 GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane, foot) navigation system.
 GpsDrive displays your position provided from a GPS on a zoomable map,
 the map file is autoselected depending on your position and preferred
 map scale.  All GPS receivers which support the NMEA protocol should
 be usable, as well as many USB GPSs using a binary protocol.
 .
 This package only contains the FriendsDaemon. It is used to 
 communicate the Position between different GpsDrive Clients via UDP.
 This program is only needed once on a central server.
