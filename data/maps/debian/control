Description: GpsDrive default continental overview mapset
 GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane, foot) navigation system.
 GpsDrive displays your position provided from a GPS on a zoomable map,
 the map file is autoselected depending on your position and preferred
 map scale.  All GPS receivers which support the NMEA protocol should
 be usable, as well as many USB GPSs using a binary protocol.
 .
 This Package contains the overview maps for GpsDrive.  These are
 derived from the NASA's Blue Marble satellite maps. These maps will
 get you started, but you will probably want to download or create
 some local maps of your own.
